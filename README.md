Hello everyone! We are extremely excited to present our Mina node performance dashboard to all of mina community members.
We are DSRV, a validator and blockchain infrastructure provider based in South Korea. As a cohort 1 genesis founding member and testnet MVP of Mina, we have been making technical & community contributions since the start of Mina protocol.  
As part of our contribution, we built an essential tool for node management and monitoring at Mina protocol and would like to introduce to all of you :)

## What is Mina performance dashboard?
Mina performance dashboard is a node monitoring tool, crucial for all block producers and snarkers at Mina protocol who operates a node. 
With this dashboard, node operators can easily monitor all of the key metrics in running a mina node.
In a single screen, the dashboard shows you the node uptime, current operational status, how many blocks or snarks are produced and many more!
And all of this amazing features will be presented to mina community members in testnet 4.1 for FREE.

## Why should I use it?
Mina performance dashboard is an open-sourced project and anyone can visit the repository at the link (https://github.com/dsrvlabs/mina-performance-dashboard), follow the setup instructions and run their own hosting server.
However, running a monitoring server in addition to your block producer & snarker node is a very huge burden both in terms of time and money.
As a team for developing the dashboard, DSRV would like to share our technical and operational knowledge with community members and help you to better run your own node.
Mina community members can use our service for FREE and better run & operate nodes to produce more blocks and snarks! 

## How can I receive the benefits?
We will start providing our service from testnet 4.1 and so on (in the mainnet as well of course) and would have a seperate website for any mina community member to submit their application.
Unfortunately, we would have to receive your application via google form just for testnet 4.1, until our platform is ready. (We are preparing something all mina community members would LOVE SO MUCH!!)
Sign up right now to enjoy our service, we will send you your own personal ID and password to access the performance dashboard.

  - Contributor: DSRV

- Type: Open source

A performance dashboard that enables block producers to view the metrics that help them have a good understanding of their nodeâ€™s performance and identify ways to optimize the operation. The dashboard will present information such as memory & CPU, slots won, blocks produced as % fo slots won, uptime %, block gossip latencies by node, and many other metrics.
Snarker Performance Dashboard

 - *Contributor: DSRV*
 
- Type: Open source

A performance dashboard that enables snarkers to view the metrics that help them have a good understanding of their snarking operations, and identify ways to optimize the operation. The dashboard will present information such as memory & CPU, # of snarks added, # of sold snarks as % of added snarks that were sold, uptime %, snarker fees, and many other metrics.
